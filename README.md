For what it's worth, solving this question will make an enormous difference for anyone who trims sails without seeing them. Even basic trim indications will change how both non-sighted and sighted people sail (plenty of sighted use cases).

## what's useful about the leech telltale?

I've not heard anyone mention exploring leech telltales for this purpose. The strongest argument for exploring leech telltales would be that even the basic, off-the-shelf version shipped with jibs and mainsails gives incomparably clear information. They key into the smallest, most innocuous beginnings of a stall, and they give very early, very definitive feedback. It's a dead simple yes or no (an actual binary). The information is communicated immediately and with high accuracy. The simplicity and reliability is in dramatic contrast to other indicators. They avoid the complex measurements, calculations and delay inherent in other options (e.g. divergent motion/vibration between port and starboard luff woolies, or changes to the curve of sailcloth at the luff).

Below is a link to an article by Mike Ingham about the jib leech telltale. Mike gives very practical, clear details on what I attempted to illustrate with handwaving earlier today. It's been 2 years since I read it, but I remember it as the definitive word on upwind jibsheet adjustments. Maybe other racers on this thread can also chime in on how well Mike's relatively brief writeup hones in on the few reliable signs that you've maximized jibsheet adjustments for close-hauled sailing. It's also worth noting a lot of the same information applies to close hauled mainsails.

The article is "Boatspeed: the Jib and Flow," by Mike Ingham, published in Sailing World August 12, 2014: http://www.sailingworld.com/how-to/boatspeed-jib-and-flow

Mike's article doesn't cover important considerations like draft, twist, angle of attack, leech give and forestay sag, but for the elite-level, blind sail trimmers mostly experience windward-leeward, intense races in club-owned boats. Most club-owned boats limit your ability to alter these parameters on a jib while racing. 

Since leech telltales generally don't get much attention when you sail off the wind, does anyone have thoughts on whether they should be ignored for points of sail other than upwind? Any other dead-simple trim indicators to recommend for off the wind?

This tech will be universally useful (i.e. for all sailors regardless of acuity, including fully sighted, and regardless of racing vs cruising).

A few more from a quick search for 'leech telltale' on the Sailing World website, several of which mention difficulty of seeing leech telltales:
