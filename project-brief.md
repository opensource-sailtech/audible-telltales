# project brief: describing audible trim tech
purpose: fully integrate blind mainsail and jib trimmers into 'mainstream' competitive sailing team.
intent: develop audible/haptic/other non-visual equivalent of telltales, which will emit a signal (e.g. sounds) that indicate optimal flow over each side of a sail; anticipate starting with leech telltale on the mainsail and jib, eventually expanding to other locations on those sails and on the spinnaker.  
people: experienced sailblind team (2nd in 2014 blind nationals) composed of Pauline Dowell (blind sailor, main trimmer, MIT employee), Grace Olsen (sighted guide, tactician, Tufts engineering student, Tufts sailing team member), Kay VanValkenburgh (sighted guide, helm, local business owner, Viper 640 owner, Viper 640 class governor), Karen Kingsbury (local business owner, Viper 640 owner, jib trimmer).  
platform: Viper 640, which is a 3-to-4 person racing boat; rig easily dropped and raised; boat easily transported to various sailing venues; 2 of the project participants own one; community of Viper 640 owners value controlled innovation and initiatives for making sailing more inclusive.

# eventual areas to address  
## key measures  
### points on mainsail to perceive, in order of priority  
- Leech tension / twist (2nd batten tip). What to look for: most often both upwind and off the wind it should just be flicking with slight turbulence; occasionally it should break 50% of the time.

### points on sail controls to perceive  
- mainsheet ease (to shrouds, to spi blocks, ...)  
- gnav (max, slack, and each inch between)  
- outhaul (max, slack, and each inch between)  
- cunningham (max, slack, and each inch between)

# Challenges  
## Preliminary Questions  
What kind of sensor do we choose?  
Should we have multiple types of sensors?  
How do we reduce signal noise?  
How do we connect the system (particularly in regards to wind/water resistance, avoiding tangling with lines when tacking, etc)?  
How many sensors will we need?  
What will we use for audible feedback?  
What will we use for our processor (Arduino, Raspberry Pi, etc)?
