# project brief: describing audible trim tech
purpose: fully integrate blind mainsail trimmer into 'mainstream' competitive sailing team.
intent: develop audible equivalent of telltales, which will emit sounds that indicate optimal flow over each side of a sail; anticipate telltales to be placed at various points on the mainsail, eventually expanding to jib and spinnaker.  
people: experienced sailblind team (2nd in 2014 blind nationals) composed of Pauline Dowell (blind sailor, main trimmer, MIT employee), Grace Olsen (sighted guide, tactician, Tufts engineering student, Tufts sailing team member), Kay VanValkenburgh (sighted guide, helm, local business owner, Viper 640 owner, Viper 640 class governor), Karen Kingsbury (local business owner, Viper 640 owner, jib trimmer).  
platform: Viper 640, which is a 3-to-4 person racing boat; rig easily dropped and raised; boat easily transported to various sailing venues; 2 of the project participants own one; community of Viper 640 owners value controlled innovation and initiatives for making sailing more inclusive.
