## partial history

2018-12-12 MIT PPAT project; see https://github.com/TosinOlabinjo-MIT/audibleTelltales & https://www.instructables.com/Audible-Telltales/; Pauline Dowell, Kay and Grace Olsen provided input and opportunities to test on Pauline's Beneteau 361, Konik Morski.

- engage tone generator when leech telltale ribbon streams; disengage when ribbon moves >100 degrees (or some similar number)
- possibly use binary switch

2016-01 Grace Olsen's Master's Project; Grace's writeup on LinkedIn:
Telltales are pieces of yarn attached to the sail that sailors use to determine if the boat is correctly trimmed. The yarn flutters differently in the wind based on whether flow around the sail is laminar or turbulent. A simple device, telltales are easy to learn to use - unless you can't see. Working with the Boston blind sailing community, I was inspired to create a mechanism that converts information from telltales into an audible signal. 

2015-04-26 project brief ( copied from Kay's writeup at https://trello.com/c/wPQKkQCM/4-project-brief, deciding after a few years of discussing requirements that it was time to start producing the real thing ): DESCRIBING AUDIBLE TRIM TECH, a list shared with the Rogue Lemmings Sailing Team (Pauline Dowell, Christian Thaxton, Grace Olsen) and Karen Kingsbury (avid supporter)
Description
purpose: fully integrate blind mainsail trimmer into 'mainstream' competitive sailing team.
intent: develop audible equivalent of telltales, which will emit sounds that indicate optimal flow over each side of a sail; anticipate telltales to be placed at various points on the mainsail, eventually expanding to jib and spinnaker.
people: experienced sailblind team (2nd in 2014 blind nationals) composed of Pauline Dowell (blind sailor, main trimmer, MIT employee), Grace Olsen (sighted guide, tactician, Tufts engineering student, Tufts sailing team member), Kay VanValkenburgh (sighted guide, helm, local business owner, Viper 640 owner, Viper 640 class governor), Karen Kingsbury (local business owner, Viper 640 owner, jib trimmer).
platform: Viper 640, which is a 3-to-4 person racing boat; rig easily dropped and raised; boat easily transported to various sailing venues; 2 of the project participants own one; community of Viper 640 owners value controlled innovation and initiatives for making sailing more inclusive.
